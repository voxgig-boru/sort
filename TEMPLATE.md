# Using this template

**Forking `sort` to start a new boru library? Read this first, then
delete it.**

This repo is a GitHub *template* for a small, single-purpose **boru library**.
It is also a real, runnable library (a sorting library — every well-known
sort, driven by composable comparators), so everything here — tests, docs,
CI, and the agent configuration — is a working example you adapt rather than
a skeleton you fill in. Clone it with **“Use this template”**, then walk the
checklist below.

The pair repo [`trie`](https://github.com/voxgig-boru/trie) follows the same
structure for a *multi-module* library; look there if your library ships
several modules/namespaces.

## The shape you’re inheriting

```
<lib>.aql                     the library — one module exporting one namespace
boru.jsonic                   package manifest (name, main, files)
api.json                      machine-readable API manifest (for agents)
AGENTS.md                     the canonical agent/human calling guide
CLAUDE.md                     Claude Code entrypoint; @-imports AGENTS.md
README.md                     human landing page
TEMPLATE.md                   this file — delete after instantiation
LICENSE                       MIT
.gitignore
.claude/
  settings.json               registers the SessionStart hook
  hooks/session-start.sh      builds boru @ main HEAD in remote sessions
  skills/<lib>-aql/SKILL.md   portable, auto-loaded agent skill (canonical copy)
.claude-plugin/
  marketplace.json            this repo is also a plugin marketplace
plugins/<lib>-aql/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json  plugin manifest
  skills/<lib>-aql/SKILL.md   BUNDLED copy of the skill (must equal the canonical one)
.github/workflows/
  test.yml                    GitHub Actions: build boru, run every suite + the gate (divergence) + consistency jobs
docs/                         Diátaxis docs: tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation
bench/                        performance baseline (run.sh, BASELINE.md)
test/
  divergence/run.sh           the gate: every suite runs green + boru check clean (CI runs it)
  <lib>_unit_test.aql         example-based unit tests — imperative (Test.test)
  <lib>_unit_spec.aql         example-based unit tests — declarative spec
  <lib>_prop_test.aql         property tests — imperative (Test.check-prop)
  <lib>_prop_spec.aql         property tests — declarative spec
  <lib>_smoke_test.aql        end-to-end smoke run over every public word
```

In this template, `<lib>` is `sort` and `<Ns>` is `Sort`: the library is
`sort.aql`, the tests are `sort_*`, the skill is `sort-aql`.

---

## Conventions this template encodes

- **Test naming:** `<subject>_<unit|prop>_<test|spec>.aql`, plus one
  `<project>_smoke_test.aql`. `unit` vs `prop` is the *what*; `test` =
  imperative surface (`Test.test` / `Test.check-prop`), `spec` = declarative
  data surface (`Test.run-spec` / `Test.run-property`). `<subject>` is the
  library name for a single-module library (e.g. `sort_unit_test.aql`), or
  the variant name for a multi-module one (e.g. `radix_unit_test.aql`). Every
  assertion-bearing suite ends with the same tail and prints `all green`;
  smoke suites carry no assertion (pass = no error).
- **boru version: track `main`.** The CI workflow, the SessionStart hook and
  `test/divergence/run.sh` all resolve boru-lang/boru `main` HEAD at run
  time (no pinned commit). `api.json`’s `verified_against` records the last
  commit the docs were re-verified on; bump it (and the "verified against"
  lines in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and the skill) when you re-verify.
- **One execution path.** `boru X` checks, compiles to bytecode and runs on
  the VM — there is no interpreter and no `--compile` family of flags, so
  "the suite runs" means "the suite fully compiles". The gate
  (`test/divergence/run.sh`) requires every suite to exit 0 and print
  `all green`, and `boru check` to report 0 errors on every suite and
  module.
- **Agent docs, layered (kept self-contained, guarded against drift):**
  `AGENTS.md` is the canonical prose guide; `CLAUDE.md` `@`-imports it;
  `.claude/skills/<lib>-aql/SKILL.md` is a strict condensation that auto-loads;
  `api.json` is the machine-readable signature source; `docs/reference.md` is
  the prose signature source. The bundled plugin SKILL.md must stay byte-equal
  to the canonical one (CI checks this).
- **Docs follow Diátaxis** (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation), with
  `docs/how-to.md#install-and-run-boru` as the canonical install anchor and
  `docs/how-to.md#run-the-tests` as the canonical test anchor (README links
  to both).
- **`.aql` module header** opens with: one-line summary, the exported
  namespace(s), a description of the public surface, a `Calling convention:`
  paragraph, and the imported-deps line.

## Instantiation checklist

Replace `<lib>` with your library name (kebab-case, e.g. `skip-list`) and
`<Ns>` with your namespace (PascalCase, e.g. `SkipList`). The worked example
here is `sort` / `Sort`.

1. **Rename the module.** `git mv sort.aql <lib>.aql`; rewrite it for your
   data structure, exporting one `<Ns>` namespace. Keep the header shape.
2. **`boru.jsonic`** — set `name`, `main: <lib>.aql`, `files: [<lib>.aql]`.
3. **Tests.** `git mv` the five `sort_*` files to `<lib>_*`; rewrite their
   bodies. Keep the standard tail + `all green`.
4. **`api.json`** — set `name`, `description`, the `Sort` → `<Ns>` namespace,
   and `word_specs` with your exact call shapes, arg order, and return types.
   Set `verified_against` to the boru main commit you verified on.
5. **`AGENTS.md`** — rewrite the calling convention, API tables, idioms, and
   common mistakes for `<Ns>`. This is the single source agents read.
6. **`CLAUDE.md`** — update the one-line description; it `@`-imports `AGENTS.md`
   so it needs no API content of its own.
7. **Skill + plugin.** `git mv .claude/skills/sort-aql
   .claude/skills/<lib>-aql` and `plugins/sort-aql plugins/<lib>-aql`;
   rewrite both `SKILL.md` copies (keep them identical) and update
   `marketplace.json` + `plugin.json` (name, source, description,
   homepage/repository).
8. **SessionStart hook** — in `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, set the smoke
   path to `test/<lib>_smoke_test.aql` (it builds boru at main HEAD).
9. **CI** — in the workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`), list your suites
   with clear step labels, point the static check at `<lib>.aql`, and update
   the `consistency` job’s plugin paths. In `test/divergence/run.sh`, set
   `MODULES`, `SUITES` and `SMOKE`.
10. **Docs** — rewrite `docs/*` for your domain; keep the four-mode structure
    and both the install and run-the-tests anchors.
11. **`README.md`** — rewrite for your library (drop the “Using this as a
    template” pointer).
12. **Delete `TEMPLATE.md`** (this file).
13. **CI** — a repo created with “Use this template” inherits the workflow and
    runs it on the first push/PR (just enable Actions for the new repo).

When the rename is done, `for f in test/*.aql; do boru "$f"; done` should end
every suite with `all green`.
